Trace through the [ripple carry adder](https://lodev.org/logicemu/#id=ripple_carry_adder) to see how different calculations take different amounts of time. 

come up with 2 example addition problems that demonstrate how much the time can vary(one short, one long), comment on this issue and have them ready at the start of class. 

*hint* use electron mode instead of immediate and it will count.  There is also a "reload" button that will reset the counter.
