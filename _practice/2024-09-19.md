1. Update your KWL chart with any learned items.
2. Get set up so that you can contribute to the course website repo from your local system. Note: you can pull from the `compsys-progtools/fall2024` repo, but you do not not have push permission, so there is more to do than clone.  Append the commands used and the contents of your `fll2024/.git/config`to a {index}`git-remote-practice.md`. Then, using a text editor (or IDE), wrap each log with three backticks to make them [fenced code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) and add headings to the sections. 
3.  [learn about options for how git can display commit history](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Viewing-the-Commit-History).  Try out a few different options.  Choose two, write them both to a file (from the command line, not copy&paste), {index}`gitlog-compare.md`. Then, using a text editor (or IDE), wrap each log with three backticks to make them [fenced code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks)  and then add text to the file describing a use case where that format in particular would be helpful.
