1. Analyze the xor hashing algorithm in the notes to determine which properties of a cryptographic hash are/not met. Include your analysis in {index}`xorhash.md`
2. find 2 more real world examples of using other number systems (either different bases or different symbols and bases) **not mentioned in class** that are currently used. Describe the number system and its usage in {index}`numbers.md`. Include links to your sources and be sure that the sources are trustworthy. 
3. Calculate the maximum number of git objects that a repo can have without requiring you to use more than the minimum number of characters to refer to any object and include that number in  {index}`gitcounts.md`  with a title `# Git counts`. How many files would have to exist to reach that number of objects assuming every fiile was edited in each of two commits? *If you get stuck, outline what you know and then request a review.*
